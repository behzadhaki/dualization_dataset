lluis and genis capture more the essence of the rythm
morgan and pau also take the hihat very present 
something feels wrong overal with these recordings since i had to cut them for them to fit in the time of the original
looks like they got streched? i cant be sure because some notes do fit. It feels like that because non of them get do the snare like the original
