luis and genis are very similar on all repetitions and also with morgans' 3rd and paus' third.
all of them did a pretty accurate representation of the loop. 

In general in loops where the rythm is more present and theres is not as much elements of the drum being played really fast
the dualisations end up being very accurate and most of them are equal between repetitions and drummers.
