these all feel like a mess, i tried putting all of luis's taps into a single note and it seemt like it got a bit better since that rythm is 
heavy on the drumroll and all of them as one would do, did the drumroll on both hands but that separates the same sound into two


would be interesting to see the dualisations without separating the right and left, basically just with silence and a sound
