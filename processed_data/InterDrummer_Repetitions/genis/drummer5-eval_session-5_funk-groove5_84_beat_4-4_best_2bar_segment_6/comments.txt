luis and genis' feel like they got the rythm right and also look really similarm, whereas morgan's 2nd and 3rd attempt looks really similar too 
but i think swapping left and right for morgan's 1st would make it feel the same as the others, pau tries to get the hi hat too much and 
it feels like it just follows the tempo.
